# Pizza App with ReactJS

This is code that I wrote in preparation for the assessment. The code is incomplete at the moment (no sorting functionality), but it gives some insight into how I approached the project with only self-instruction.

## To use

There are several simple server implementations included. They all serve static files from `public/` and handle requests to `/api/comments` to fetch or add data. Start a server with one of the following:

### Node

```sh
npm install
node server.js
```

### Python

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server.py
```

### Ruby
```sh
ruby server.rb
```

### PHP
```sh
php server.php
```

### Go
```sh
go run server.go
```

### Perl

```sh
cpan Mojolicious
perl server.pl
```

And visit <http://localhost:3000/>. Try opening multiple tabs!

## Changing the port

You can change the port number by setting the `$PORT` environment variable before invoking any of the scripts above, e.g.,

```sh
PORT=3001 node server.js
```
